<h3>Icicle Creek</h3> 
<p><img class="align-left" src="creek.jpg" width="259" height="387" alt="Icicle Creek" /></p>

<p style="margin-right: 200px">Take a hike along Icicle Creek and watch the majestic waters flow. Enjoy the soothing sounds of the rushing water while standing amidst the surrounding trees. This hike is rated a double-boot because climbing is moderately strenuous. However, the land immediately around the creek is flat and allows for frequent rest stops.</p>

<p>There are so many hikes to choose from. Visit our Web site or stop by one of our offices to learn about other exciting hikes. We can design a hike to meet your needs or the desires of your group.</p>
